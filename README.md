# lil-gulp-zip
Simple example of archiving globbed files with `gulp-zip`. Includes a trivial example of mocking an internal user module and a less-trivial example of testing file zipping against the file system.

## todo
Testing against the filesystem is not the least-brittle way to do this. TBD, explore mocking the file system.
